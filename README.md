I started with following the instructions in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf3-aDXG8q4
Then I had some ideas for improvements, such as keeping a score.
So after googling for a bit I found this article, which was helpful in getting a deeper understanding of pygame: https://nerdparadise.com/programming/pygame/
